## Description
In here I will describe what I've done on this Assessment.

### Profile Section

- First I adjust the layout based on the wireframe from the desktop view to mobile view by making it fall down that which adapted based on smartphones and tablets screen size.
- In the text box I've added the placeholder to optimize User Experience so Sista will not confuse for what the input format that should inputed
- For the text box I've added the validation, if the Sista forget to input it will appear the notice that Sista should input the empty text box.
- In the label I've added the mandat that which indicates that text box can't be empty.


### Order Section
- the Load button below the text box I make it to be not clickable before Sista input the the order number in the "Nomor Order" text box.
- After Sista click the load button the content of list items that Sista ordered before will appear also the "bukti foto" i made it become clickable and showing the pop up image so Sista can view the item that she has purchased.
- The Tables of item that Sista purchased I made scrolling to the right, because almost of user lazy for too much scrolling their phone to the bottom.
- The "Keterangan" text area field I made it become lower height to make user low expectation that the text area box should inputed longer, because if the "Keterangan" text area field have high height the user will have expectation that box should inputed longer and make her lazy to input on it.


### Order Section
- Because the bank section has been removed I've added the voucher section with the button and caption "Get Voucher" inside, also I've added the notice "Selamat, kamu berhak mendapatkan voucher sebesar Rp.300.000" that will indicates the sista get voucher based on price of the product.
- If the Sista want to claim the voucher, She must click the get voucher button and input the Sista email so the voucher will be send to her email.

Accordingly the explanations that I made for the "Return online page"

Thank You
